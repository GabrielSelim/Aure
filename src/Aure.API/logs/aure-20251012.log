System.InvalidOperationException: The LINQ expression 'DbSet<UserInvite>()
    .Where(u => !(u.IsDeleted))
    .Any(u => u.InviteeEmail.ToLower() == __ToLower_0 && !(u.IsAccepted) && !(u.IsExpired) && !(u.IsDeleted))' could not be translated. Additional information: Translation of member 'IsExpired' on entity type 'UserInvite' failed. This commonly occurs when the specified member is unmapped. Either rewrite the query in a form that can be translated, or switch to client evaluation explicitly by inserting a call to 'AsEnumerable', 'AsAsyncEnumerable', 'ToList', or 'ToListAsync'.
